Project start date: 3/2025
The goal of this project is to learn PCB design using KiCad. 
The specfic goal of this project is to build a PCB that plugs into a USB port and using the power lines from the USB device, it will power a ATtiny84 that controls two shift registers which controls the 8x8 led matrix. 

Please check out the images/ for schematic images and pcb 3d layout images. :)

I would like to create a library for various different animations. And eventually even be able to install custom libraries for custom animations for friends and family. 

If you would like to talk about this project, maybe give some advice or ask questions, feel free to send me an email at gaugehasbrouck@gmail.com
